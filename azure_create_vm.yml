# This playbook will create a VM in Azure
# Inputs:
# - vm_name: the name part of the fqdn
# - os_type: linux or windows
# - role: The role for this server. This is needed to open firewall ports in Azure (not in the VM itself)
#         it is also used to tag the VM so the VM will end up in the correct group when doing dynamic inventory
# Note: it needs to have a machine credential that will be used to give the VM it's initial credentials. This
#       machine credential needs to be of type username/password
